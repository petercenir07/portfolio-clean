                                <p className="mb-[20px] text-[15px] xl:text-[18px]"><strong>Hi! I&apos;m Peter Samuel Vergel from Binangonan Rizal, Philippines. I&apos;m a freelance and full-time Front-End Developer</strong>. As a developer, I translate design into a functional and responsive website. I also ensure that it is optimized and creatively done. I&apos;m always eager to learn and usually express it by keeping myself updated to the latest technologies. I do collaborate with other developers by joining communities and trainings so that Iâ€™ll be able to know how other developers write their codes and learn from them.</p>
                                <p className="mb-[20px] text-[15px] xl:text-[18px]">I started my career in my first company as a Front-End Web Developer, specialized in creating Real Estate Websites in 2019. After several years, I got promoted as a Full Stack Web Developer. As I always seek for career growth, after a year I have decided to look for another company that aligns with my career path. Currently, I have been working on my new company as a Front-End Developer focused on creating business websites.</p>
                                <p className=" text-[15px] xl:text-[18px]">Work Life Balance is very important specially on developers because most of the day, we think a lot of ways to figure out how to build things and to fix bugs. Therefore, to refresh my mind and to relax, I either play video games or spend time with my family and friends.</p>
